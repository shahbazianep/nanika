iOS application developed to promote positive mental health. Utilizes the concept of emotional contagion to improve mental health by allowing users to realize their emotions are not unique, permanent, or widespread. Users can join and view "clusters" to anonymously see others emotions that day. There is also a journaling/logging function, which allows an individual user to privately log and track their emotions and experiences over time to track growth and change.
